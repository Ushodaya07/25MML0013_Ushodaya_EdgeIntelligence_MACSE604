# Audio Data Digitalization and Dense Vector Representation  
## Edge Intelligence – Lab 1

---

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **basic audio data digitalization pipeline** using a real-world audio dataset.  
The objective of this lab is **not model training**, but to understand:

- How audio data is collected from a dataset
- How audio is converted from sound into numerical form (digitalization)
- How numerical audio samples are represented as vectors
- How dense feature vectors are extracted from digital audio
- How these vectors are organized for Edge Intelligence applications

This work is intended as a **first laboratory experiment** in the subject **Edge Intelligence**.
